**Code Files:**

Project_1_Code.ipynb : This is the cleaning code that we used to reformat the raw data set downloaded from the NIH website. This code also generates the visualizations that we used in our original data understanding phase to direct the future analysis.

Project_1_Analysis: This is the code where we run a few final cleaning functions and then the actual analysis of the data. This is where the conclusions and analysis methods can be found.

Project 1 Presentation: This file includes the slides that will be presented in class.
