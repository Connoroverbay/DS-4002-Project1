# DS-4002-Project1

**Software and Platforms:**
All of the code created in this project was run through the google colab platform for the ease of collaboration and sharing. Packages that are used in the file include pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplot, sklearn, and math functions. All of these package downloads are included in the code to make sure that anyone who runs the code can reproduce the results. The program was run across different computers but the online nature of the coding process prevented any problems with the type of computer platform that we individually used. 


**Code Files:**

 1: Software and platform section
○ The type(s) of software you used for the project.
○ The names of any add-on packages that need to be installed
with the software.
○ The platform (e.g., Windows, Mac, or Linux) you used.



Project_1_Code.ipynb : This is the cleaning code that we used to reformat the raw data set downloaded from the NIH website. This code also generates the visualizations that we used in our original data understanding phase to direct the future analysis.

Project_1_Analysis: This is the code where we run a few final cleaning functions and then the actual analysis of the data. This is where the conclusions and analysis methods can be found.

Project 1 Presentation: This file includes the slides that will be presented in class.
